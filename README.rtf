Codes are written using the Jupyternotebook. Results will be printed by running all the codes in sequence.
The .py file is generated based on the Jupyternotebook. If .py file does not work, please check the Jupyternotebook. Thanks in advance! 
 

The codes covered three main parts:
1 Data preprocessing including adding start symbols and end symbols and handle low frequent words in training set and out of vocabulary words in dev set.  
2. Bigram viterbi with linear interpolation smoothing. Accuracy are report for using different rules. 
3 Trigram viterbi with inear interpolation smoothing. Hyper-parameters (rules and lambdas) are choosen based on the performance of the dev set.
